# github-writeup
## This write-up will be how I processed and everything I know about git,github and ides when I learn't about them in unit 2 back in mp3 semester 1 which was called: "Commandline,Git and Github"
## 1:So github is a website where aspiring and future web developers can use to plabn how to code,type and develope their own websites and webpages,how to preform maintaince and repairs on them and how to update them so they will always have visits from the general public online.While Git on the other hand is basically a fancy name for a common computer feature that saves and restores the folders and files of the user and has many key componets and details to it as is better than folder and file version saver on google docs any day.And finally the IDE in which people use to practice their coding skills for websites and what not.In the space below I will go over evrything I know abput Git and Github as well as merging and linking files along with a few other things and finally my conclusion on this write up.
### 1:So lets start out with Git clone URL.So when somebody wants to clone their github repository into their IDE they go to the code of their repo in github,copy the ssh url and paste it into their code and this allows them to edit and do it on their ide.An exampkle is when we had to do this in the Restaurant guide and we had to do the same thing for it and we had to be careful with code as any wrong move we had to restartall over again.So this the information on the GIt clone Urls.
### 2:Next we have Git Status which basically allows uis to check in on the staus of our files in our URL and basicallly what we do is press git status in the folder or file we are in and it shows everything currently in the file/folder but this won'twork if we arent in any directories/subdirectories(they arte bassically the same as folders and files but different names).An example is if I am checking out my Ide I can pull this out and it shows me the status of the directories and sub directories of my ide.
### 3:Now we have Git add files which allows us to add files to the staging index of our IDE and we basically do thjis if we need more room or something.An example is we are working on a folder if we need to add files we put in the command git add files and we basically get the extra files we need for the folder.
### 4:Next is git add which allows us o add whatever we need to the staging area of our directory.However it doesen't really affect the repo unless we git commit.An example is when we are working on our repo we use this to add whatever we need to it before we commit which is what I am gonna talk about next.
### 5:Next is git commit-m "message" which we press after we are done dditing our git adding our repo and this basically saves everything we edited on the repo for us.An example is if we are doing a github writeup like this when we are done editing what we need in this repo we press commit and boom the repo is now updated with the new desired information of the user.
### 6:Next is Git push which pushes the current branch we are working on to the branch in our repository with the same name.However if the file exists it won't work and would send an error message to the user which says "(error message: “<branchname> has no upstream branch”)".Now an example of this working successfully is if we need to add a branch to our repo we make sure both have the same name and do it with the order oof the git push.An example of this not working is when the repo has the same branch and if we try adding in the same one that's when it will send in the error message.
### 7:Git diff is a command that allows us to see our last commit to ou repo and basically shows what we added to it.An example is when we need to change our repo we use this command to see our last commit so we know what there and we can see what needs removal or addition.
### 8:Git log is a command that allows us to see our previous commits and if we have to get back to our current we type in Q.An example is when we need to check the commit history of our repo and we use this command and once were done we press Q and get back to our current commit.
### 9:Now the command q (while in git diff/log) would basically allows us to return to our currnet repo/commit from the history log our previous through this code.An example is when we are done looking through the logs/diffs our repo we put in this command an we are back into the present.
### 10:Git restore file is when we use this command to restore a deleted file and we do this by this command in and put in the name of the file and boom its back.An example is when we need to restore a file to our giut hub we put in this command and the files name such as i.e abc file and boom its back in the repo.
### 11:Git restore --staged file is when we restore a previous version of the fiel back to the repo for whatever reason.An example is asy we need to change something back in the file we put in this command and the files name and boom we have the staging back and do what we need to do.
### 12&13:Git revert SHA/Head is the command we use to undo an existing commit on our repo and would be used if we made a mistake on the current repo.An example is if we find a mistake on the current commit we put in this code and the name of the commit and we can undo the mistake and make a new commit n the fixed repo.
### 14:Finally Git pull allows us to see/edit our repo and ad fix and commit on any mistakes.For example if we anted to fix/see a repo we put its name along with the git pull and boom the repo comes back to us.
### Now that we've gone over all commands now to talk about merging and linking files.First is linking and it is basically what it sounds like we link files together back to back so they me bore connected and organized and people can switch back and forth between each file.Now merging is a bit more compliicated as it is two files by two diffrent owners merging into one file/folder/repo and basically both owners can see eachj others work and they can work together on this merged file/repo/folder aslong as they are working on diffrent parts at the same time.If both work on the same part at the same time it would lead to amerge conflict and mess up the file.So to prevnt this they need to work on diffrent parts of the file at anytime they want or work on the same part at diffrent times.
### Now we have collarbartion which is when two file owners work together one on one either merged or shared.
### Now we have pull requests is hwen somebody sends a request to the owner of a repo to suggest changing something of the repo and the owner has the power to deny/allow the rquest.An example is if one guy sends a pull requset to  another guy the other guy has the power to deny or allow it.
### now finally forking is when we fork somebody's repo or like copy it as our own and we can do whatever we like on it at our expense.An example if a teahcer psosts a repo as an example to his students they can fork it and use it for however they like to do it.
### In conclusion this write up shows everything I learn't about git,github and ides in was called: "Commandline,Git and Github" in unit 2 back in mp3 semester 1, from simple git adds to forking and how I've process it.I hope you all enjoy the write-up and I hope to see you all on my next write for unit 3 "Advanced Web Design;Responsive Web Design & Bootstrap) in mp1 of the second semester.Bye.
